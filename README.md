# Battling Climate Change: Implications on the Canadian Climate Policies in Recent Years

## Abstract
In this paper, we have fitted a multiple linear regression model to predict the annual national greenhouse gas (GHG) emission in Canada and determined that investments in business, machinery equipment, and exports are the economic factors that are contributing the most to Canada's annual GHG emissions. With the current data presented, we are not able to foretell the future trend of Canada's GHG emissions as we cannot quantify how the economy is going to behave after the pandemic has ended. However, there remains hope as the Government of Canada is actively trying to suppressing the production of GHG, and the innovation of a renewable and green source and energy is imminent. Fulfilling the Paris Agreement (reduce GHG emission levels in 2030 to 30% below the 2005 levels) is the first step toward mitigating the devastating effects of climate change and providing the future generation with a safe world to live in, not a corrupted one.
